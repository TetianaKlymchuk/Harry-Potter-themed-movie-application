# Harry-Potter-themed-movie-application

## I am a big fan of Harry Potter and when I was facing to the problem of choosing a topic for my future application, I was pretty fast in my choise. In fact, it is possible to choose any theme you prefer.

### In this application one can get started using Node.js and Express.js. 

### I have studied how to install Node and how to use npm to install express and other node modules. I spend time (sometimes a lot) going over basic Express.js concepts, such as routing, using templates, partials, writing embedded JavaScript, and the folder structure for a typical application. I also went over how to use a JSON file to get data for an application, added a lot of logic to our routes file, create a dynamic route that passes in information dynamically, wire up the navigation and links.

Here are some of Screenshots:


In order to execute the application in is necessary to make the following steps:

- Write the following command in the command line to install all required packages:
```
npm install
```
- Write the following command in the command line to start an application:
```
node app.js
```
- Open  http://localhost:3000/ in your browser
- Enjoy!
