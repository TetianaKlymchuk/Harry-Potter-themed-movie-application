# Harry-Potter-themed-movie-application

I am a big fan of Harry Potter and when I was facing to the problem of choosing a topic for my future application, I was pretty fast in my choise. In fact, it is possible to choose any theme you prefer.

 In this application one can get started using Node.js and Express.js. 

 I have studied how to install Node and how to use npm to install express and other node modules. I spend time (a lot) going over basic Express.js concepts, such as routing, using templates, partials, writing embedded JavaScript, and the folder structure for a typical application. I also went over how to use a JSON file to get data for an application, added a lot of logic to our routes file, create a dynamic route that passes in information dynamically, wire up the navigation and links.

### Screenshots:

The home page consists of the list of all movies about Harry Potter indicated by posters

Each page, dedicated to the one particular movie, has the name of this movie, bottoms "Home" and "Movie" which allow to come back to the homepage or to another movie respectively:
